## Development tools and why

### Poetry

We use [Poetry] as a dependency management tool to keep track
of the libraries needed to built the project. This makes it 
easier for anyone to replicate the project. Plus it's straightforward
and well documented.

### Invoke

[Invoke](https://www.pyinvoke.org/) is our task runner of choice. 
It inherits a minimal yet powerful philosophy from GNU Make and is 
broadly use among the Python community.
